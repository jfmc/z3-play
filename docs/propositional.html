<h2>Propositional Logic</h2>

<p>
The pre-defined sort <bb>Bool</bb> is the sort (type) of all Boolean propositional expressions.
Z3 supports the usual Boolean operators <tt>and</tt>, <tt>or</tt>, <tt>xor</tt>, <tt>not</tt>, <tt>=&gt;</tt> (implication), <tt>ite</tt> (if-then-else).
Bi-implications are represented using equatity <tt>=</tt>.
The following example shows how to prove that if <tt>p</tt> implies <tt>q</tt> and <tt>q</tt> implies <tt>r</tt>, then <tt>p</tt> implies <tt>r</tt>.
We accomplish that by showing that the negation is unsatisfiable. The command <bb>define-fun</bb> is used to define a macro (aka alias). 
In this example, <tt>conjecture</tt> is an alias for the conjecture we want to prove.

<h3>Satisfiability and Validity</h3>

<p>A formula <tt>F</tt> is <b>valid</b> if <tt>F</tt> always evaluates to true for any assignment of appropriate values to its
uninterpreted function and constant symbols. 
A formula <tt>F</tt> is <b>satisfiable</b> if there is some assignment of appropriate values
to its uninterpreted function and constant symbols under which <tt>F</tt> evaluates to true. 
Validity is about finding a proof of a statement; satisfiability is about finding a solution to a set of constraints.
Consider a formula <tt>F</tt> with some uninterpreted constants, say <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>. 
We can ask whether <tt>F</tt> is valid, that is whether it is always true for any combination of values for 
<tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>. If <tt>F</tt> is always
true, then <tt>not F</tt> is always false, and then <tt>not F</tt> will not have any satisfying assignment; that is, 
<tt>not F</tt> is unsatisfiable. That is, 
<tt>F</tt> is valid precisely when <tt>not F</tt> is not satisfiable (is unsatisfiable).
Alternately,
<tt>F</tt> is satisfiable if and only if <tt>not F</tt> is not valid (is invalid).
Z3 finds satisfying assignments (or report that there are none). To determine whether a
formula <tt>F</tt> is valid, we ask Z3 whether <tt>not F</tt> is satisfiable. 
Thus, to check the deMorgan's law is valid (i.e., to prove it), we show its negation to be unsatisfiable.</p>
